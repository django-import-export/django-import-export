==============================
Installation and configuration
==============================

django-import-export is available on the Python Package Index (PyPI), so it
can be installed with standard Python tools like ``pip`` or ``easy_install``::

    $ pip install django-import-export

This will automatically install many formats supported by tablib. If you need
additional formats like ``cli`` or ``Pandas DataFrame``, you should install the
appropriate tablib dependencies (e.g. ``pip install tablib[pandas]``). Read
more on the `tablib format documentation page`_.

.. _tablib format documentation page: https://tablib.readthedocs.io/en/stable/formats.html

Alternatively, you can install the git repository directly to obtain the
development version::

    $ pip install -e git+https://github.com/django-import-export/django-import-export.git#egg=django-import-export

Now, you're good to go, unless you want to use django-import-export from the
admin as well. In this case, you need to add it to your ``INSTALLED_APPS`` and
let Django collect its static files.

.. code-block:: python

    # settings.py
    INSTALLED_APPS = (
        ...
        'import_export',
    )

.. code-block:: shell

    $ python manage.py collectstatic

All prerequisites are set up! See :doc:`getting_started` to learn how to use
django-import-export in your project.



Settings
========

You can configure the following in your settings file:

``IMPORT_EXPORT_USE_TRANSACTIONS``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Controls if resource importing should use database transactions. Defaults to
``True``. Using transactions makes imports safer as a failure during import
won’t import only part of the data set.

Can be overridden on a ``Resource`` class by setting the
``use_transactions`` class attribute.

``IMPORT_EXPORT_SKIP_ADMIN_LOG``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If set to ``True``, skips the creation of admin log entries when importing.
Defaults to ``False``. This can speed up importing large data sets, at the cost
of losing an audit trail.

Can be overridden on a ``ModelAdmin`` class inheriting from ``ImportMixin`` by
setting the ``skip_admin_log`` class attribute.

.. _IMPORT_EXPORT_TMP_STORAGE_CLASS:

``IMPORT_EXPORT_TMP_STORAGE_CLASS``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Controls which storage class to use for storing the temporary uploaded file
during imports. Defaults to ``import_export.tmp_storages.TempFolderStorage``.

Can be overridden on a ``ModelAdmin`` class inheriting from ``ImportMixin`` by
setting the ``tmp_storage_class`` class attribute.

``IMPORT_EXPORT_IMPORT_PERMISSION_CODE``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If set, lists the permission code that is required for users to perform the
“import” action. Defaults to ``None``, which means everybody can perform
imports.

Django’s built-in permissions have the codes ``add``, ``change``, ``delete``,
and ``view``. You can also add your own permissions.

``IMPORT_EXPORT_EXPORT_PERMISSION_CODE``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If set, lists the permission code that is required for users to perform the
“export” action. Defaults to ``None``, which means everybody can perform
exports.

Django’s built-in permissions have the codes ``add``, ``change``, ``delete``,
and ``view``. You can also add your own permissions.

``IMPORT_EXPORT_CHUNK_SIZE``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

An integer that defines the size of chunks when iterating a QuerySet for data
exports. Defaults to ``100``. You may be able to save memory usage by
decreasing it, or speed up exports by increasing it.

Can be overridden on a ``Resource`` class by setting the ``chunk_size`` class
attribute.

``IMPORT_EXPORT_SKIP_ADMIN_CONFIRM``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If ``True``, no import confirmation page will be presented to the user in the Admin UI.
The file will be imported in a single step.

By default, the import will occur in a transaction.
If the import causes any runtime errors (including validation errors),
then the errors are presented to the user and then entire transaction is rolled back.

Note that if you disable transaction support via configuration (or if your database
does not support transactions), then validation errors will still be presented to the user
but valid rows will have imported.

``IMPORT_EXPORT_ESCAPE_HTML_ON_EXPORT``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If set to ``True``, strings will be HTML escaped. By default this is ``False``.

This is deprecated and will be removed in a future release.  Future releases will
escape strings by default.

``IMPORT_EXPORT_ESCAPE_FORMULAE_ON_EXPORT``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If set to ``True``, strings will be sanitized by removing any leading '=' character.  This is to prevent execution of
Excel formulae.  By default this is ``False``.

``IMPORT_EXPORT_FORMATS``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A list that defines which file formats will be allowed during imports and exports. Defaults
to ``import_export.formats.base_formats.DEFAULT_FORMATS``.
The values must be those provided in ``import_export.formats.base_formats`` e.g

.. code-block:: python

    # settings.py
    from import_export.formats.base_formats import XLSX
    IMPORT_EXPORT_FORMATS = [XLSX]


``IMPORT_FORMATS``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A list that defines which file formats will be allowed during imports. Defaults
to ``IMPORT_EXPORT_FORMATS``.
The values must be those provided in ``import_export.formats.base_formats`` e.g

.. code-block:: python

    # settings.py
    from import_export.formats.base_formats import CSV, XLSX
    IMPORT_FORMATS = [CSV, XLSX]


``EXPORT_FORMATS``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A list that defines which file formats will be allowed during exports. Defaults
to ``IMPORT_EXPORT_FORMATS``.
The values must be those provided in ``import_export.formats.base_formats`` e.g

.. code-block:: python

    # settings.py
    from import_export.formats.base_formats import XLSX
    EXPORT_FORMATS = [XLSX]


.. _exampleapp:

Example app
===========

There's an example application that showcases what django-import-export can do.
It's assumed that you have set up a Python ``venv`` with all required dependencies
(from ``test.txt`` requirements file) and are able to run Django locally.

You can run the example application as follows::

    cd tests
    ./manage.py makemigrations
    ./manage.py migrate
    ./manage.py createsuperuser
    ./manage.py loaddata author.json category.json book.json
    ./manage.py runserver

Go to http://127.0.0.1:8000

For example import files, see :ref:`getting_started:Test data`.
